# Rendering and API-fetching - different types

**[< Go home](/)**

## Client-side rendering and client-side api fetching

Client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR) are two different approaches to displaying content in a web application. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them often depends on the specific needs of the application. Similarly, client-side and server-side API fetching have their own set of pros and cons. Let's delve into each of these concepts.
Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

How it Works:

In CSR, the server sends a minimal HTML page to the client's browser without the actual content. JavaScript is then used to render the content on the browser, fetching data with API calls and generating the HTML on the client side.

Pros:

Rich Interactions: Allows for dynamic interactions without needing to reload the page.
Less Server Load: Reduces the load on the server since the server only provides the API endpoints, not the rendered pages.
Single Page Applications (SPAs): Enables the development of SPAs, which can provide a smoother user experience.

Cons:

Slow Initial Load: The first load might take longer since the browser needs to download, parse, and execute JavaScript before displaying the content.
SEO Challenges: Search engines might struggle to index content rendered entirely on the client side, although advancements in search engine technology have mitigated this issue somewhat.
Heavy Browser Workload: Puts more processing work on the client's device, which can be a problem for devices with lower performance.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

How it Works:

With SSR, the server sends a fully rendered HTML page to the client's browser, so the page is ready to be displayed as soon as it arrives. JavaScript might still be used to enable dynamic interactions after the initial page load.

Pros:

* Fast Initial Load: Provides a faster initial page load time, improving the perceived performance.
* SEO Friendly: Since the content is rendered on the server, search engines can easily crawl and index the pages.
* Consistent Performance: The server does the heavy lifting, which can provide a more consistent performance across different devices.

Cons:

* Higher Server Load: Increases the workload on the server, as it has to render pages for each request.
* Less Interactive: The page needs to be reloaded or partially updated with techniques like AJAX for any dynamic content changes, which can lead to a less fluid experience compared to SPAs.
* Latency: Each interaction that requires new data might result in a round trip to the server, potentially increasing the wait time for the user.

## Client vs. Server-Side API Fetching

### Client-Side API Fetching

Pros:

* Dynamic Content Update: Allows for updating content dynamically without reloading the page.
* User-Specific Content: Can fetch data specific to the user's actions or preferences in real-time.

Cons:

* Dependent on Client Resources: Relies on the client's device performance and internet speed.
* Initial Load: May delay the initial rendering if the data fetching is integral to the page content.

### Server-Side API Fetching

Pros:

* SEO Benefits: Data fetched during server-side rendering can improve SEO as the content is pre-loaded.
* Performance Optimization: Can improve load times by pre-fetching data and serving the fully rendered page to the client

Cons:

* Server Load: Increases the load on the server, especially with a high number of requests.
* Flexibility: Less flexible in responding to user interactions dynamically compared to client-side fetching.

The choice between client-side rendering, server-side rendering, and where to fetch data (client or server) depends on the application's requirements for performance, SEO, interactivity, and the expected user experience.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

Static Site Generation (SSG) is another approach to building and serving web applications. Unlike Client-Side Rendering (CSR) or Server-Side Rendering (SSR), SSG generates all the pages of the website at build time. These pre-rendered HTML files are then served to the client, potentially with JavaScript to enable dynamic interactions after the initial load.

How it Works:

During the build process, a static site generator transforms content and templates into a set of static HTML pages. These pages are then ready to be served directly to the browser without the need for real-time rendering or data fetching on the server or client side.

Pros:

* Performance: Static sites load quickly because they are just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files being served from a CDN or a simple web server. There's no database query or template rendering at request time.
* Security: With no server-side code execution or database interactions at runtime, static sites have a smaller attack surface compared to dynamic sites.
* Scalability: Handling traffic spikes is easier with static sites because serving static files is less resource-intensive than serving dynamic content. CDNs can easily distribute and cache static assets globally, further improving scalability and performance.
* Hosting and Cost: Static sites can be hosted on any web server or a CDN, often resulting in lower hosting costs. Many providers offer free or low-cost hosting solutions for static websites.
* SEO Friendly: Since the pages are pre-rendered, search engines can easily crawl and index the content, improving SEO performance.

Cons:

* Dynamic Content: Static sites are not inherently suited for applications requiring real-time updates or dynamic content that changes frequently based on user interactions or external data sources.
* Site Updates: To update the content or design, you need to rebuild and redeploy the entire site, which can be cumbersome for large sites or for sites that require frequent updates.
* User-Specific Content: Serving personalized content or implementing user authentication flows can be challenging and might require client-side JavaScript or third-party services to handle these dynamic elements.

Static Site Generation is particularly well-suited for blogs, documentation sites, and corporate websites where content does not change frequently. Modern static site generators like Gatsby, Hugo, and Next.js (when used in static generation mode) offer the best of both worlds by allowing for static site generation with the option to incorporate dynamic elements through client-side JavaScript or serverless functions.
